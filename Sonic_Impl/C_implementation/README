This repository contain the C reference implementation for Sonic256 and Sonic512

The representation of the state is the following :

0      63 64    127 | 128    192 193     256
    left input      |      right input



The makefile compile the .c files to run test for 256 and 512 bit version, and to test the differential probability of an r round differential.
