In this repository we provide code to test the diffusion properies of Sonic.
This code allow testing those two cipher for different state size and for different number of round.


For each cipher and each size we compute three metric: the avalanche dependency,
the avalanch weight and the avalanche entropy.

We provide a Makefile to compile the code and creat the executable diffusion
We give as argument to the executable:

./diffusion

In the file diffusion_exe.c the main containe the test to do.
