In this repository we provode python code for computing differential and linear trail for Sonic.

Those python code use the Gurobi Solver to solve MILP model
Thise code is writen with python3 

To compute differential trail :  python3 diff_trail_search_sonic.py SIZE nbr_round file_rotation_val

To compute linear trail : python3 linear_trail_search_sonic.py SIZE nbr_round file_rotation_val

the python code take a file of rotation set and compute trail for nbr_round for each set of rotation and print the ones with the highest minimal weight


To give a specific set of rotation value :

   python3 exe.py SIZE (nbr_round_start (nbr_round_end))

where the p and q variable are according to the specification.
The number round start and end are optional, if none is given then trail are computed for 1 to 7 round,
if only a start is given then trail are computed for one round wich is the start,
if start and end are given then trail a computed from start to end.
