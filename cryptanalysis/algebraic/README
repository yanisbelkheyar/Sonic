    python3 anf_experiment.sage.py nbr_round (nbr_round_end)

    if used with one argument, the distribution of degree and the number of terme are computed for the number of round specify
    if used with two argument, the distribution of degree and the number of terme are computed for the number of round arg1 to arg2

Example:
	#compute and print the distribution of degree and the number of term for one round of sonic
	 python3 anf_experiment.sage.py 1

	 #compute and print the distribution of degree and the number of term for two round of simon
	 python3 anf_experiment_simon.sage.py 2

	 #compute and print the distribution of degree and the number of term for one to 3 round of sonic
